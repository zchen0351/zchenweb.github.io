abstract: |
  This cross-cultural study examined how emotional expression norms vary across Western and East Asian cultures and how these differences relate to subjective well-being. Using survey data from 800 participants across four countries, we found that the relationship between emotional expression and well-being was moderated by cultural values of individualism-collectivism.
