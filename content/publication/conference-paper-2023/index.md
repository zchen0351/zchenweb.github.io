abstract: |
  We conducted a 30-day daily diary study with 200 participants to examine how social support moderates the relationship between daily stressors and mental health outcomes. Results showed that perceived social support significantly buffered the negative effects of stress on mood and anxiety symptoms, particularly for individuals high in neuroticism.
